           title = {WeightLifter: Visual Weight Space Exploration for Multi-Criteria Decision Making},
         journal = {IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics},
        abstract = {A common strategy in Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is to rank alternative solutions by weighted summary
scores. Weights, however, are often abstract to the decision maker and can only be set by vague intuition. While previous work
supports a point-wise exploration of weight spaces, we argue that MCDM can benefit from a regional and global visual analysis of
weight spaces. Our main contribution is WeightLifter, a novel interactive visualization technique for weight-based MCDM that facilitates
the exploration of weight spaces with up to ten criteria. Our technique enables users to better understand the sensitivity of a decision to
changes of weights, to efficiently localize weight regions where a given solution ranks high, and to filter out solutions which do not rank
high enough for any plausible combination of weights. We provide a comprehensive requirement analysis for weight-based MCDM
and describe an interactive workflow that meets these requirements. For evaluation, we describe a usage scenario of WeightLifter
in automotive engineering and report qualitative feedback from users of a deployed version as well as preliminary feedback from
decision makers in multiple domains. This feedback confirms that WeightLifter increases both the efficiency of weight-based MCDM
and the awareness of uncertainty in the ultimate decisions.},

        abstract = {DimStiller is a system for dimensionality reduction and analysis. It frames the task of understanding and transforming input dimensions as a series of analysis steps where users transform data tables by chaining together different techniques, called operators, into pipelines of expressions. The individual operators have controls and views that are linked together based on the structure of the expression. Users interact with the operator controls to tune parameter choices, with immediate visual feedback guiding the exploration of local neighborhoods of the space of possible data tables. DimStiller also provides global guidance for navigating data-table space through expression templates called workflows, which permit re-use of common patterns of analysis.},
